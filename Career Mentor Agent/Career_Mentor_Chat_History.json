Your Current Situation:**\n\n* **Current Role:** What's your current job title and responsibilities?\n* **Industry:** What industry are you currently in?\n* **Skills & Experience:** What are your strongest transferable skills (e.g., communication, problem-solving, leadership, technical skills)?  List any relevant experience, even if it seems tangential to your target field.\n* **Reasons for Switching:** Why are you looking to switch careers? What are you hoping to gain (e.g., higher pay, more fulfilling work, better work-life balance, new challenges)?\n* **Financial Situation:** How much financial runway do you have?  Are you comfortable taking a pay cut initially?  Do you have savings to support yourself during the transition?\n\n**2. Your Target Career:**\n\n* **Desired Role:** What specific job title are you aiming for?\n* **Industry:** What industry are you targeting?\n* **Required Skills & Qualifications:** What are the key skills and qualifications needed for this role (e.g., certifications, degrees, specific software proficiency)?  Research job postings to identify these.\n* **Salary Expectations:** What's your realistic salary expectation in your target field?\n\n**3. Your Plan:**\n\nOnce we have this information, we can develop a tailored plan that might include:\n\n* **Skills Gap Analysis:** Identifying the skills you need to acquire and how to acquire them (courses, certifications, volunteer work, networking).\n* **Networking Strategy:**  Developing a plan to connect with people in your target field (LinkedIn, informational interviews, attending industry events).\n* **Job Search Strategy:** Crafting a compelling resume and cover letter that highlight your transferable skills and demonstrate your enthusiasm for the new field.  We'll discuss job boards, recruitment agencies, and other job search methods.\n* **Financial Planning:**  Developing a budget to manage your finances during the transition.\n* **Timeline:** Establishing a realistic timeline for achieving your career goals, including milestones and deadlines.\n\n\nThis is a collaborative process. I'll provide guidance and resources, but your active participation is crucial.  The more detail you provide upfront, the more effective our planning session will be. Let's start with your current situation.  Tell me about your current role and why you want to switch careers.\n"
